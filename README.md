# Active Directory Project

In this project, I'll be setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2022. I'll explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help you detect them in the future.

## Logical Diagram

The first step was to come up with a logical diagram in order to understand how the data would flow between the nodes. I used draw.io for this since it was the easiest option to come up with a logical diagram
